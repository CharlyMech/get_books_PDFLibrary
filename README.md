# PDFLibrary info scrapping script

This Python script is used to get all book's information (text and files) from [OpenLibra](https://openlibra.com/ "OpenLibra's home page").

The script takes (for now) a list of links (desired book's url) in a csv format and gets all the information needed for the database and server storage (pdf and book cover image files)
